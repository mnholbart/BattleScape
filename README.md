# BattleScape GearVR Game

Made for the "Oculus' Mobile VR Jam 2015." Submission exists here http://devpost.com/software/battlescape-ky70r

Too large in scale for the short development cycle for the game jam it was never finished, however there are some valuable 
assets to retain from it such as the hexagon grid editor. It was developed in Unity 4.6 as Unity 5 support for the GearVR plugins
were unreliable.

Most efforts were focused early on into the framework of the hex grid editor and due to time constraints the concepts were not fully realized. The project was an introduction for me to some of the other sides of Unity such as particle systems, animation state machines, and incorporating art assets.
