# BattleScape GearVR Game

Made for the "Oculus' Mobile VR Jam 2015." Submission exists here http://devpost.com/software/battlescape-ky70r

Too large in scale for the short development cycle for the game jam it was never finished, however there are some valuable 
assets to retain from it such as the hexagon grid editor. It was developed in Unity 4.6 as Unity 5 support for the GearVR plugins
were unreliable.
